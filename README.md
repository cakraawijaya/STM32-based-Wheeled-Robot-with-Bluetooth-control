# STM32-based-Bluetooth-Radio-Control-Car-Robot
<strong>Solo Project STM32-based BTRC Car Robot</strong><br><br>
In operation, this robot car requires a battery as its power supply. Then the user can control its movement by using a bluetooth signal. If the receiver is close to the transmitter, the signal generated will be stronger, while on the contrary, the signal generated will be weaker.
